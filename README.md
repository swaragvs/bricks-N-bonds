# ⚙️ Tech Stacks Lab — by Swarag

Welcome to **Tech Stacks**, my personal learning lab where I explore, practice, and learn & build with a wide range of programming languages, tools, and frameworks. Each folder here represents a specific tech stack, filled with mini-projects, code experiments, and reference notes.
